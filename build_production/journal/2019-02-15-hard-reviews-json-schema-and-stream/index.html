        <p>Hey there. How was your day?</p>
<p>So, today, was the Sprint Retrospective. We digressed about all situations, good and bad, about this sprint. I won't share details, of course, but we did talk about what I shared in yesterday's article: too much optimism. Everybody agreed on being more realistic. By the end of the retrospective, we came up with a pretty solid plan so that it won't happen again. We're always learning, we'r enot perfect. But we're still an awesome Team. üê±‚Äçüèç</p>
<p>After that, Gon√ßalo presented the Team with a tech talk about JSON Schema. I've never really took the time to be familiar with the RFCs presented, but I was very impressed about the potentialities of integrating this with our API. If I had to bet money I would bet that Gon√ßalo is already investigating about how to do it, gradually. üòè</p>
<p>On another topic, I'm very tempted to start a streaming channel on Twitch, every Saturday afternoon, were I'd be working on pet projects or other programming related stuff. I've always fantasised about streaming myself working. However, if I do it, it'll be completely in portuguese, my main language. I think portuguese audience needs content on our mother language and I'm willing to do it, just for the sake of it. </p>
<p>What you think? Would you be interested in watching me work and interact with me? I have to admit, in advance, that I don't have the best equipment to stream (I only have a very low budget webcam) so the sound and video quality will be a little low, at least for the first few episodes while I see if it sparks any real interest of the portuguese public.</p>
<p>Anyway, to finish today's blog post, I have to talk about this daily blog posts. I got to say I was not expecting that anyone would find interest in reading this. I don't plan the content of these articles. I just... Write! However, I've been receiving nice feedback from a few readers. It's nice to know. I accept critiques, also, so if you have anything to say, ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/josepostiga">Twitter</a>.</p>    </div>
