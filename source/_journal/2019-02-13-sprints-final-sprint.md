Hey there, how was your day?

Today I continued my work on the report class. I don't think I've said this before but this is the main feature to be dispatched this Sprint (the Epic). I started talking with Jo√£o, my team leader, about my difficulties until today, mainly because of the domain logic I'm still lacking. He, graciously, made himself available to help me and Ricardo, by supervising and helping us, ad-hoc, with the domain logic necessary to unlock us. Always with the sensibility to not do anything for us, besides consulting. This is key.

I haven't seen this in a long time. It shows that there's attention to not giving us all the answers, right away, but to make sure that we solidify our knowledge about the domain. With his help and high coordination from the team, we were able to push most of the necessary features for the report. Tomorrow will be the day to finish the last section, still missing and create the pull request for code review and testing.

One thing I've been able to do was to keep doing TDD and it helped me keeping track of problems in between iterations from the first solution to final refactor.

I can't wait to finish this task and get feedback from the code review. If there's one thing that has been happening is that I've been learning a lot working with this team.

Btw, we're hiring! Check the positions here: http://home.infraspeak.com/pt-pt/empregos
