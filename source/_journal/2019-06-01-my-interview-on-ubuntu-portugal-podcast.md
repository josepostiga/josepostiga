It's no surprise to anyone who knows me that I've been very disappointed with Apple's Macintosh products. The hardware has gotten next-to-zero valuable updates, except on the prices (got higher, every year). Since I work mainly with web technologies, I'm exposed to Linux environments, on a daily basis, and one thing I've noticed is how good it has become, either for everyday work, and for gaming! In fact, it has come to a point that made possible for me to transition all my personal machines to the Linux Ubuntu distro.

This complete change sparked the interest of the nice people at Ubuntu Portugal Podcast and they invited me to chat a little about the whys and hows of this complete change. You can listen to the episode [here](https://podcastubuntuportugal.org/ep-56-laravel-dingo/).
