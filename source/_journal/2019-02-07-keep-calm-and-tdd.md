Today was a very calm day. I finally confirmed that the code sniffers and fixers are configured on all of my teammates' computers. I continue observing how they're reacting to the new development process, with the pull requests, code reviews and PSR-2 compliant code. So far, so good. I'm really proud of their effort. ðŸ‘Œ

The most noteworthy part of the day was right after lunch when my colleague Luis Bessa came to me to ask me about how to start using TDD. I tried to give him a crash course about the thinking process: first, break the problem in little steps, then stub any dependencies that are required to exist for the test to run (for example, any entity and/or relations) and then using the right assertions for the required result. During this crash course, I showed him some examples of unit and feature tests, explaining, line by line, what was happening. Finally, I referred him to Laracasts, a very good project with several courses about TDD.

Besides this, I haven't had time to advance on the HUB project, unfortunately. However, I promise I will have news tomorrow! ðŸ¤ž
