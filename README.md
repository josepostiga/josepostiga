I’m José Postiga, and I am a Senior Software Engineer at Procuros.io. Previously, I held the position of Staff Software Engineer at Infraspeak.

I’ve contributed to various open-source projects, including PHP Portugal, Laravel-Portugal, VOST, Fogos.pt, and the popular PHP framework Laravel. Additionally, I have experience as a speaker, mentor, writer, and podcaster.

Since 2008, I have been responsible for developing well-tested, scalable APIs in service-oriented architectures. I have also managed teams of multidisciplinary professionals, implementing a culture of continuous integration and delivery, testing, documentation, and providing mentorship to enhance developers’ technical skills.

In my spare time, I enjoy [writing](https://josepostiga.com) about technology, web development, and programming topics. I also maintain this blog where I document my work experiences and thoughts.
