I'm Jos√© Postiga. Senior Lead Backend Developer at [Infraspeak](https://infraspeak.com), speaker, mentor, and writer.

I've work with web-related technologies, mainly PHP and Golang, developing well-tested, scalable, APIs in service-oriented architectures, implementing a culture of continuous integration and delivery, documentation, and help developers improve their technical skills through mentoring sessions.

Besides that, I like to write about tech/web/programming topics and I talk a lot about my daily work in my [journal](https://josepostiga.com).
