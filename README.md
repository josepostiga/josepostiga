I’m José Postiga. Backend Staff Engineer at [Infraspeak](https://infraspeak.com). I contribute and volunteer to well-known projects like PHP Portugal, Laravel-Portugal, VOST, and Fogos.pt. I’m also a speaker, mentor, and writer.

I’ve been developing well-tested, scalable, APIs in service-oriented architectures since 2008. I’ve also been managing teams of multidisciplinary professionals, implementing a culture of continuous integration and delivery, testing, documentation, and helping developers improve their technical skills through mentoring sessions and internal workshops. 

Besides that, I like to write about tech/web/programming topics and I talk a lot about my work in my [journal](https://josepostiga.com).
