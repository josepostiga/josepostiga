I'm Jos√© Postiga. Senior Lead Backend Developer at [Infraspeak](https://infraspeak.com). I contribute and volunteer to well-known projects like [Laravel-Portugal](https://github.com/laravel-portugal), [VOST](https://github.com/vostpt), and [Fogos.pt](https://github.com/fogospt). I'm also a speaker, mentor, and writer.

I've been working with web-related technologies since 2008 by developing well-tested, scalable, APIs in service-oriented architectures. I've also been managing teams of multidisciplinary professionals, implementing a culture of continuous integration and delivery, documentation, and help developers improve their technical skills through one-on-one mentoring sessions.

Besides that, I like to write about tech/web/programming topics and I talk a lot about my daily work in my [journal](https://josepostiga.com).

You can see my career history at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josepostiga/?locale=en_US) profile, and if you have any questions, or simply want to chat, contact me directly via e-mail or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/josepostiga). Come say hi!
