# About me

I’m José Postiga. Senior Backend Engineer @ [Procuros.io](https://procuros.io) (previously: Backend Staff Engineer at [Infraspeak](https://infraspeak.com)). I contribute and volunteer to well-known projects like PHP Portugal, Laravel-Portugal, VOST, Fogos.pt, and many others. I’m also a speaker, mentor, and writer.

I’ve been developing well-tested, scalable, APIs in service-oriented architectures since 2008. I’ve also been managing teams of multidisciplinary professionals, implementing a culture of continuous integration and delivery, testing, documentation, and helping developers improve their technical skills through mentoring sessions and internal workshops. 

Besides that, I like to write about tech/web/programming topics and I talk a lot about my daily work in my [journal](https://josepostiga.com).
