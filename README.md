I'm Jos√© Postiga, a Senior Backend Developer at [@infraspeak](https://infraspeak.com/) by day, a co-host on [@LaravelPortugal](https://twitter.com/LaravelPortugal) Podcast, and a contributor on various Open Source Software projects by night!

I've been working with web-related technologies since 2008, mainly with Symfony, Laravel and CodeIgniter, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, jQuery and VueJS. I've also been getting very comfortable with DevOps, especially with Docker. You can see my career history at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josepostiga/).

Besides that, I like to write about [tech/web/programming](https://josepostiga.com/tag/articles/) topics and I talk a lot about my daily work on my [journal](https://josepostiga.com/tag/journal/), and I occasionally share pictures on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jose.postiga/). Besides all this, I have an [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHL2W2GzLsgc_TLAr5CejCQ) channel and a [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/iamjosepostiga) channel, where I make videos and stream myself developing software projects. You should check them out!

You can contact me directly, too, via [Telegram](https://t.me/josepostiga) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/josepostiga).
