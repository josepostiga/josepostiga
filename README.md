I’m José Postiga, and I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Procuros](https://procuros.io). Previously, I held the position of Staff Software Engineer at [Infraspeak](https://infraspeak.com).

Since 2008, I have been responsible for developing well-tested, scalable, APIs in service-oriented architectures, working with a wide-spectrum of technologies and programming languages, and leading teams composed of different sizes and multidisciplinary professionals in the planning and execution of many projects, implementing a culture of continuous integration and delivery, testing, documentation, and providing mentorship to enhance developers’ technical skills.

I’m very focused on problem solving and help companies break through their bottlenecks and technical challenges. From startups to scale-ups, I’m very used to the speed, agility, and commitment required to succeed in today’s business worlds.

In my spare time, I enjoy writing about technology, web development, and programming topics, and contribute to various open-source projects like PHP Portugal, Laravel-Portugal, VOST, Fogos.pt, and the popular PHP framework Laravel. Additionally, I have experience as a speaker, mentor, writer, and podcaster.
