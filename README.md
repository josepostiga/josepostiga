I'm Jos√© Postiga, Lead Backend Developer at [@infraspeak](https://infraspeak.com/), co-host on [@LaravelPortugal](https://twitter.com/LaravelPortugal) Podcast, and a contributor on various open-source software projects.

I've been working with web-related technologies since 2008, mainly with PHP, Docker, PostgreSQL, developing well-tested APIs in service-oriented architectures, and implementing a culture of CI/CD. I also have experience with some frontend technologies (Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, jQuery, and a little of VueJS), Golang, and Kafka.

Besides that, I like to write about tech/web/programming topics and I talk a lot about my daily work in my [journal](https://josepostiga.com).
